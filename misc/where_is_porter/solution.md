Werther's Original => Werther (place name) is red herring

Werther's Original => [Werther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werther) is an opera by a Frenchman

That added that with the "pierre cardin" pen refill confirms the French-ness

And the watch says 1898 which is close to 1892: the year when Werther received its first premiere at the Imperial Theatre "Hofoper" in Vienna. It's "Vienna State Opera" in english.
