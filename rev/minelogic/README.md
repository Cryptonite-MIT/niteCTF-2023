## Description

Like everyone in this world, John Doe has a lock and a key. He knows the 3 bit lock is 110 but he has lost all the 8 bit keys. Help him find all the keys.

Flag format: Arrange all keys in ascending order, join with `_` and wrap it with `nite{}`

## FLAG

nite{01101011_01101101_01101110_11011000_11011100}

## Solution

The user will be given the minecraft world and a 3 bit output(represented by lamps).The entire circuit has to be reverse engineered to find all the possible 8 bit inputs possible to get the given 3 bit output and then concatenate them in ascending order to give the flag.
Outputs attached along with the circuit.
